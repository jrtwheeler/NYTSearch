  ## Description
  I like reading the New York Times and its archives are a first draft of this countries history. I can search for old articles to read about the Lincoln Douglass Debates, the First World War, or Babe Ruth's rookie season. I wanted to write a simple search that uses the New York Times API to standardize my filters. I also wanted to take this opportunity to develop my skills in JQUERY and Bootstrap.
